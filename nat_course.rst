New course: QGIS for naturalists
-----------------------------------

An in-depth course on free and open source GIS, focused on the popular `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`_ software and its application in natural sciences (ornithology, mammalogy, ecology), in one of the most scenic environments in Italy, the `Maremma Natural Park <http://www.parco-maremma.it/en_html>`_. You'll master the software, at the same time enjoying beautiful landscapes, and birdwatching at will.

Every day you'll enjoy an alternance of GIS training and excursions in the Park. Every moment will be good to discuss practical applications of GIS.

During the evenings we'll have the opportunity for sharing knowledge and experience both about nature and GIS, and for socializing, around a table with good local food and drinks.

* dealing with projections: how to fit your data in
* working in the field: the options
* working with GPS
* georeferencing and displaying images and photos
* ecology and nature plugins: a wealth of resources
* analysing data: raster, vector, tables
* home ranges and movements
* using the full power: GRASS, R, SAGA, OTB
* easily creating models (e.g. habitat suitability) and batch analyses
* remote sensing and land use analyses
* preparing beautiful maps
* mass production of maps (e.g. for distribution areas)
* show your data: simple webGIS.

Total duration of the training: 24 h of lessons + practical examples throughout the day.
